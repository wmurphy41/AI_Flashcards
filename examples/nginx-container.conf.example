# ===============================
# AI Flashcards — Nginx Container Configuration
# ===============================
#
# This is the nginx configuration used INSIDE the frontend Docker container.
# It is copied into the container during the production build process.
#
# Location in container: /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
#
# -------------------------------
# When to Use This File
# -------------------------------
# - This file is used by the production frontend Docker image
# - It handles routing within the container (SPA routing, API proxying)
# - For server-level nginx configuration (reverse proxy on host), see:
#   examples/nginx-server.conf.example
#
# -------------------------------
# Configuration Overview
# -------------------------------
# - Serves static files from /usr/share/nginx/html (built React app)
# - Handles SPA routing (all routes serve index.html)
# - Proxies /api/* requests to the backend container
# - Enables gzip compression for better performance
#
# ===============================

server {
    # Listen on port 80 inside the container
    # This port is exposed and mapped by Docker Compose
    listen 80;
    
    # Server name (wildcard accepts any hostname)
    # In production, the host-level nginx will handle domain routing
    server_name _;
    
    # Root directory for static files
    # This is where the built React app is located
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    
    # Default file to serve for directory requests
    index index.html;

    # -------------------------------
    # SPA Routing Configuration
    # -------------------------------
    # This location block handles all requests to the root path.
    # The try_files directive ensures that:
    # 1. First, try to serve the requested file ($uri)
    # 2. If not found, try the file as a directory ($uri/)
    # 3. If still not found, serve index.html (for client-side routing)
    #
    # This is essential for React Router to work correctly.
    # Without this, refreshing a page like /decks/123 would return 404.
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # -------------------------------
    # API Proxy Configuration
    # -------------------------------
    # This location block proxies all /api/* requests to the backend container.
    # The backend service name "backend" is resolved by Docker's internal DNS.
    #
    # Proxy headers are set to preserve:
    # - Host: Original host header from client
    # - X-Real-IP: Client's real IP address
    # - X-Forwarded-For: Chain of proxy IPs
    # - X-Forwarded-Proto: Original protocol (http/https)
    #
    # These headers are important for:
    # - CORS handling in FastAPI
    # - Security logging
    # - Protocol-aware redirects
    location /api/ {
        # Backend container name (as defined in docker-compose.yml)
        # Docker Compose creates a network where services can be reached by name
        proxy_pass http://backend:8000;
        
        # Preserve original host header
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        
        # Preserve client's real IP address
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        
        # Preserve forwarding chain for IP addresses
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        
        # Preserve original protocol (http/https)
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # -------------------------------
    # Gzip Compression
    # -------------------------------
    # Enables gzip compression to reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times.
    # Only compresses files larger than 1024 bytes to avoid overhead on small files.
    #
    # Compression is applied to:
    # - Text files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, XML)
    # - Application files (JavaScript, JSON)
    #
    # Binary files (images, fonts) are typically already compressed and excluded.
    gzip on;
    gzip_vary on;
    gzip_min_length 1024;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css text/xml text/javascript application/x-javascript application/xml+rss application/json application/javascript;
}

# ===============================
# Notes for Path-Based Routing
# ===============================
#
# If deploying to a subdirectory (e.g., /flashcards/), you need to:
#
# 1. Update the frontend build to use the correct base path:
#    - Set VITE_BASE_PATH=/flashcards/ during build
#    - Set VITE_API_BASE=/flashcards/api during build
#
# 2. Modify this nginx config to handle the subdirectory:
#    - Change root to: root /usr/share/nginx/html;
#    - Update location blocks to include the base path
#    - Example: location /flashcards/ { ... }
#    - Example: location /flashcards/api/ { ... }
#
# 3. Update the server-level nginx to route /flashcards/* to this container
#
# See examples/nginx-server.conf.example for server-level configuration.
